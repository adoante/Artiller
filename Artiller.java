 * Artiller is a 2-D artillery game app where players shoot 
 * down increasingly fast and numerous fleets of ships and planes 
 * before they can reach the islandâ€™s shores. Between waves,
 * the player can repair their base, increase its fortifications,
 * buy missiles and order bombing runs, and attempt to win the game 
 * by investing in a peace negotiation.
